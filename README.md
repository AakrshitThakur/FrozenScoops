# FrozenScoops
In this e-commerce front-end website, Frozen Scoops, users can add or delete ice creams (cones, flavor scoops, toppings) to the cart according to their preferences. I also created a notification badge to count the total number of ice creams selected. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to test my core front-end skills.
